## 📊 Demo

```python
from supply_chain_intelligence import SupplyChainIntelligence

# Initialize system
system = SupplyChainIntelligence("data/supply_chain_data.xlsx")

# Ask questions in natural language
system.query("What should I do if stock is critically low?")
# → AI generates actionable answer

# Generate demand forecast
forecast = system.forecast_demand("SKU0", days=30)
# → Returns 30-day forecast with recommendations

# Analyze risks
risks = system.analyze_risks(top_n=20)
# → Returns risk assessment for products
```

   ```bash
   # Model downloads automatically (~900MB) on first use
   # Takes 1-2 minutes
   ```

4. **Run the demo**
   ```bash
   python supply_chain_intelligence.py
   ```

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Query

```python
from supply_chain_intelligence import SupplyChainIntelligence

# Initialize
system = SupplyChainIntelligence("data/supply_chain_data.xlsx")

# Ask a question
result = system.query("What is the safety stock policy?")
print(result['answer'])
```

### Demand Forecasting

```python
# Generate 30-day forecast
forecast = system.forecast_demand("SKU0", days=30)

print(f"Average forecast: {forecast['metrics']['forecast_avg']} units/day")
print(f"Trend: {forecast['metrics']['trend']}")
print(f"Recommended action: {forecast['recommendations']['action']}")

# Access daily predictions
for day in forecast['predictions'][:7]:
    print(f"{day['date']}: {day['predicted_demand']} units")
```

### Risk Analysis

```python
# Analyze top 20 products
risk_df = system.analyze_risks(top_n=20)

# Filter high-risk products
high_risk = risk_df[risk_df['risk_level'] == 'HIGH']
print(f"High-risk products: {len(high_risk)}")

# Save to CSV
risk_df.to_csv('risk_analysis.csv', index=False)
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Document Search (RAG)

```
User Query → TF-IDF Search → Top 3 Documents → Context
```

- Indexes all company policies and product data
- Uses TF-IDF for relevance scoring
- No external APIs needed

### 2. AI Answer Generation

```
Context + Query → Flan-T5 (FREE) → Natural Language Answer
```

- Uses Google's Flan-T5 model (250M parameters)
- Runs locally on your machine
- No API costs, works offline

### 3. Demand Forecasting

```
Historical Data → Multi-Method Forecast → Predictions + Insights
```

- Combines moving average, exponential smoothing, and trend analysis
- Generates 95% confidence intervals
- Provides actionable recommendations

### 4. Risk Analysis

```
Product Data → Risk Scoring → Automated Recommendations
```

- Evaluates stock levels, lead times, defect rates
- Scores risks as HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- Suggests specific actions

---

## 📊 Sample Output

### Query Example

**Input:**
```
"What should I do if I have only 15% safety stock remaining?"
```

**Output (with AI):**
```
Based on the inventory management policy, 15% safety stock places you in 
RED ALERT status (below the 20% threshold). You should:

1. Initiate an emergency reorder immediately
2. Calculate reorder quantity using: ROP = (Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
3. Consider expedited shipping to restore safety levels quickly

This is a high-priority situation requiring immediate action to avoid stockouts.
```

### Forecast Example

```
SKU: SKU0
Forecast Period: 30 days
Average Forecast: 33.5 units/day
Growth Rate: +12.3%
Trend: Increasing
Confidence: 89%

Recommendations:
  Action: INCREASE inventory
  Target Stock: 469 units (2 weeks coverage)
  Reorder Point: 235 units (1 week coverage)
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `Config` class in `supply_chain_intelligence.py`:

```python
class Config:
    # AI Model (options: flan-t5-base, flan-t5-large, flan-t5-xl)
    AI_MODEL = "google/flan-t5-base"  # 250M params, fast
    
    # Search settings
    SEARCH_TOP_K = 3  # Number of documents to retrieve
    
    # Forecasting
    FORECAST_DAYS = 30  # Forecast horizon
    FORECAST_HISTORY_DAYS = 90  # Historical data to use
```

---

## 📈 Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Search Speed | < 100ms |
| AI Response Time | 1-2 seconds |
| Forecast Generation | < 1 second |
| Memory Usage | ~2GB (with AI model) |
| Disk Space | ~1GB (including model) |
